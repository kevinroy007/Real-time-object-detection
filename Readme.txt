Python script for real-time object detection using a pre-trained model like YOLO (You Only Look Once) with OpenCV. This script will use your webcam to capture video and perform object detection in real-time.

First, ensure you have the necessary files and dependencies:

YOLOv3 Weights: Download from the official YOLO website.
YOLOv3 Configuration File: Usually comes with the weights.
COCO Names File: Contains the names of the objects that YOLO can detect.
OpenCV: Install it via pip (pip install opencv-python).
